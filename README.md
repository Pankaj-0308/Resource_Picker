Project Overview : 

This project is a Custom Shopify Resource Picker. 
It’s a full-stack web application that allows users to browse and select products,
variants, or collections directly from a Shopify store without using Shopify's native UI.

Top 3 Features:

Custom Interface: Browse Products, Variants, and Collections in a custom-built pop-up window.
Secure Connection: A Node.js backend handles the API keys securely, so the frontend stays safe.
Visual Results: Selected items are immediately displayed on the main page in a clean, card-based layout.
